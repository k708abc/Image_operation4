This program is made for orocessing images from Scanning probe microscopy experiments.

The unique points of this progra are:
-The processes applied on the image is listed in "process" window. The parameters and their order can be recorded in a text file.
-The parameter in the middle process can be changed in the process window. You can check how each parameter affects the final result, without restarting processing.
-The saved process can be applied on all the images on a folder just by one click.
